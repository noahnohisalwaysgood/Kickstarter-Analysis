# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
1.	Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
a.	Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goal.
2.	Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
a.	This challenge was very challenge to me because I was not familiar with excel and basically everything was new to me. I googled to find solutions and watched youtube videos to find out how to do it. However, it was still very challenge to me. I tried many different ways to get right number but countifs was the hardest challenge I was facing during 1st challenge assignment. I asked classmates if anyone could help me out. Fortunately, there were several classmates who helped me out. Even though classmates helped me out, I still did not fully understand how it worked out and did not know what was my mistake. TA office hours helped me a lot to understand and find out what I did wrong.
3.	Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
a.	What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
i.	I could conclude that the rate of successful was skyrocketing from March to May, but it eventually dropped and about to be same value as the rate of failed. The rate of failed, meanwhile, has been constantly going sideways ranged between 30 and 60. Theater was not very successful.
b.	What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
i.	Goal amount is low more likely to increase the percentage successful. Otherwise, high goal amount is likely to decrease the percentage successful. Likewise, less than 5000, has low percentage failed but more than 5000, increases the percentage failed. 
c.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
i.	The dataset is not updated one so it may have difficulty to follow recent trend. 
d.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
i.	We could make bar graph and statistics graph based on the data we have.
